# Fundamentals of Programming & Python

Python is interpreted (code runs line-by-line by the interpreter, no separate compilation).
Indentation is crucial: Use spaces (usually 4) for blocks (no braces like in other languages). Wrong indentation causes IndentationError.
Keywords: Know common ones like if, else, for, while, def, return, try, except, break, continue, pass, in, not in.
Input/Output: print() for output, input() for user input (always returns a string, so convert with int() or float() if needed).
Comments: # for single-line, """ for multi-line.

Example:
Pythonname = input("Enter your name: ")  # Input as string
print("Hello,", name)
